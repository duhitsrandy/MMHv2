Notepad Name: Sonnet Roadmap

## **🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE** 🚨
**DO NOT SUGGEST CHANGES TO WORKING FEATURES**
- This app has working features built by other models
- Focus is on payment/premium structure completion and going live
- Only suggest changes for: efficiency, security, or adding complex new features
- Always verify current functionality before suggesting modifications
- Live traffic routing for Pro+ users is ALREADY WORKING via HERE API
- Upgrade modal system needs completion, but core feature gating works

---

## **What's Currently Working (DO NOT CHANGE)**
- ✅ Live traffic routing: Pro users automatically get HERE Matrix API
- ✅ Plan detection and feature gating logic
- ✅ Core mapping and midpoint calculation
- ✅ Database schema and user management
- ✅ Stripe backend integration (webhooks work)

## **What Actually Needs Completion**
- ❌ Frontend upgrade modal UI component
- ❌ Stripe checkout session creation flow
- ❌ Payment success/failure handling in UI
- ❌ Production deployment configuration
