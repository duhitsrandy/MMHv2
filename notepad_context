Notepad Name: Sonnet Roadmap

## **🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE** 🚨
**DO NOT SUGGEST CHANGES TO WORKING FEATURES**
- This app has working features built by other models
- Focus is on payment/premium structure completion and going live
- Only suggest changes for: efficiency, security, or adding complex new features
- Always verify current functionality before suggesting modifications
- Live traffic routing for Pro+ users is ALREADY WORKING via HERE API
- Upgrade modal system needs completion, but core feature gating works

---

## **What's Currently Working (DO NOT CHANGE)**
- ✅ Live traffic routing: Pro users automatically get HERE Matrix API
- ✅ Plan detection and feature gating logic
- ✅ Core mapping and midpoint calculation
- ✅ Database schema and user management
- ✅ Stripe backend integration (webhooks work)

## **What Actually Needs Completion**
- ✅ Frontend upgrade modal UI component (ENHANCED - shows required tier + option to view/select other plans + link to full pricing page)
- ✅ Stripe checkout session creation flow (VERIFIED - full integration with all tiers)
- ✅ Parameter mismatch bug: FIXED - upgrade modal now uses proper createCheckoutSession with priceId
- ✅ Upgrade flow integration: VERIFIED - form → triggers → modal → Stripe checkout  
- ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: usePlan hook returned 'tier' but form expected 'plan' - now fixed
- ✅ Tier comparison logic: Fixed 'free' → 'starter' to match actual tier system
- ✅ Modal props alignment: FIXED - modal now supports feature/requiredTier props as documented
- ✅ PostHog analytics (ENABLED - comprehensive tracking implemented with centralized events, analytics hook, and key user journey tracking)
- ❌ Ad monetization integration  
- ❌ Payment success/failure handling in UI
- ❌ Production deployment configuration
